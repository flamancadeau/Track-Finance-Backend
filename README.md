Enhanced Transaction Management System - Backend

# 📜 Project Overview
This is the backend server for the Enhanced Transaction Management System. It provides RESTful API endpoints to manage:

- Transactions: Add, edit, delete, and view transactions (income/expense).
- Accounts: Manage different accounts (Bank, Mobile Money, Cash).
- Categories: Categorize and subcategorize transactions.
- Budgets: Set budgets and monitor spending limits.
- Reports: Generate financial reports based on user data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend applications.
- Express.js: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database to store transactions, user data, and other related information.
- dotenv: Loads environment variables for better configuration management.
- CORS: Middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication.

### 🔮 Future Improvements

- Advanced Report Generation: Allow users to filter reports based on categories or account types.
- Notifications: Notify users about exceeded budgets or upcoming expenses.
